Bayesian
-----------
time-series: short-term, prior is important

use hidden MC in time-series

Books:
"Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers": Pearson CMG. Useful because it serves as more accessible documentation to PyMC. (The official PyMC docs assume prior knowledge of Bayesian inference.)



Software:
Stan: http://mc-stan.org. Upcoming successor to BUGS / JAGS. Compiles models to C++. Uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for posterior sampling.
Edward: http://edwardlib.org. Variational inference package for Python built on TensorFlow.
